2. **Instantly Ready-to-Use** ‚Äì no compilation required.  
3. **Small File Size** (~8 KB compressed).

## Installation & Usage

1. **Install the Extension**  
   - Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
   - Search for **‚ÄúStartr.Style Autocomplete for VS Code‚Äù**.
   - Click **Install**.

2. **Include Startr.Style in Your Project**  

   Add the following line in the `<head>` of your HTML to bring Startr‚Äôs default styles into your project:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://startr.style/style.css">
   ```
   You're always free to download the CSS file and host it locally in your project.

3. **Start Coding**  
   - Begin writing your HTML and CSS.
   - When typing style attributes or CSS properties like `--bg`, `--p`, `--br`, etc., VS Code will automatically provide IntelliSense suggestions from this extension.

### Example

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://startr.style/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <button style="--d:none; --d-md:block;">
      Not visible on phones, but visible on tablets and desktops!
    </button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here, Startr.Style‚Äôs responsive utility `--d-md:block` is applied, making the otherwise hidden button visible on tablets and desktops. This showcases how Startr.Style applies responsive design directly in the style attribute.

## Requirements

- VS Code version 1.60.0 or higher is recommended.  
- A basic HTML/CSS project structure (the extension primarily focuses on `.html` and `.css` files, but may also assist in React/JSX if style attributes are used).

## Extension Settings

At this time, the extension provides IntelliSense out of the box without additional configuration. Future settings might include:

- `startrStyle.enable`: Enable/disable the extension.  
- `startrStyle.suggestionsPriority`: Adjust the priority of Startr.Style suggestions relative to other suggestions.
- `startrStyle.autoAddStyleLink`: Automatically add the Startr.Style stylesheet link to the HTML file.

## Known Issues

- Some custom properties may not appear in certain templating or framework-based files if VS Code does not recognize them as HTML/CSS.   (e.g., `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, etc. we may resolve this in future updates).
- For best results, make sure the files are set to HTML/CSS syntax.  

If you experience any issues, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Startr/VSCODE-Startr.Style/issues).
